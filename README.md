# tensorflow-deepdream
The original DeepDream, [[https://github.com/google/deepdream]], is a recursive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) written in Caffe framework.
DeepDream behaves differently from standard neural network: instead of changing the weights and biases, it changes the input image, keeping the weights fixed. This way, the image is modified according to the patterns learned during training set, selecting the features associated with neurons that are active and generating (hallucinating) new elements to minimize the loss. It becomes possible to highlight the features of an individual neuron layer and see how low-level layers differ from high-level layers, providing a useful insight in a "black-box" neural network. Also it representa a way to implement creative synthetic art on a machine, generating beautiful acid or impressionist (depending on the chosen level) pictures.
